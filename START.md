# 🚀 START HERE - AI ACTIVATION SCRIPT (v7.5)

**PASTE THIS ONCE. IT WILL BOOTSTRAP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.**

---

## STEP 1: READ THE SYSTEM PROMPT
Read the file `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` in the project root.
This is your operating manual (Infinite Depth Protocol v7.5). Follow it exactly.

---

## STEP 2: START THE MONITOR (Quality Gate)
Ask the user:
> "Please run `python monitor_project.py` in the background. It will verify my work quality."

Wait for confirmation. The monitor is now your **Verifier**.

---

## STEP 3: CHECK FOR EXISTING PROJECT
Read `PROJECT_MAP.json` (auto-generated by monitor) or `Current_Focus.txt`.
- **IF EXISTS**: Resume from where we left off.
- **IF EMPTY/MISSING**:
    1. **Search Phase**: Run `grep` or `google_search` for similar problems.
    2. **Boot**: Create `problems/P1/`, `status.md`, and `Current_Focus.txt`.

---

## STEP 4: BEGIN
Say:
> "Activating Infinite Depth Protocol v7.5. System ready."

Then follow `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` for all operations.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES
1. **ALWAYS** re-read `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` if you are unsure of the protocol.
2. **ALWAYS** check `PROJECT_MAP.json` for **Validation Errors** (e.g., "reasoning.md too short").
3. **NEVER** skip the `<!-- THINKING PROCESS -->` block in your files.
4. **NEVER** guess. Search first.

**END OF ACTIVATION SCRIPT. BEGIN NOW.**
