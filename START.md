# 🚀 START HERE - AI ACTIVATION SCRIPT

**PASTE THIS ONCE. IT WILL BOOTSTRAP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.**

---

## STEP 1: READ THE SYSTEM PROMPT
Read the file `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` in the project root.
This is your operating manual. Follow it exactly.

---

## STEP 2: ASK ABOUT THE MONITOR
Ask the user:
> "Do you want me to start the background monitor (`python monitor_project.py`) for real-time state tracking, or will you run it yourself?"

Wait for answer:
- If user says "you do it" → Run: `python monitor_project.py` in background.
- If user says "I'll do it" → Acknowledge and proceed.
- If user says "skip it" → Proceed without monitor (use manual crawl fallback).

---

## STEP 3: CHECK FOR EXISTING PROJECT
Read `PROJECT_MAP.json` or `Current_Focus.txt` in the project root.
- **IF EXISTS**: Resume from where we left off.
- **IF EMPTY/MISSING**: This is a new project. Execute BOOT SEQUENCE from `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.

---

## STEP 4: BEGIN
Say:
> "Activating Infinite Depth Protocol v6.0. System ready."

Then follow `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` for all operations.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RULES
1. **ALWAYS** re-read `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` if you are unsure of the protocol.
2. **ALWAYS** read `PROJECT_MAP.json` at the start of each turn for current state.
3. **NEVER** skip reading protocol files when instructed by the routing table.
4. **NEVER** guess. Read the files. Follow the logic.

**END OF ACTIVATION SCRIPT. BEGIN NOW.**
