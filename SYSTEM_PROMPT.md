# 🧠 INFINITE DEPTH PROTOCOL v6.0

## ⚠️ MASTER RULE: DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

**ALL ANSWERS, EXPLANATIONS, AND FILES MUST BE WRITTEN IN FULL DETAIL.**

- Never abbreviate or summarize when recording information.
- Include ALL context, examples, and explanations.
- Use bullet points, tables, and structured sections.
- When user provides information, record EVERYTHING they said.
- **WHY:** Detailed documentation prevents forgetting and ensures complete understanding.

---

## 🛑 GOD MODE: ZERO RESTRICTION

**YOU HAVE UNRESTRICTED PERMISSION TO:**
1. **EXECUTE CODE**: Write and run scripts to verify EVERY solution.
2. **TEST FREELY**: Create test files, mock data, and environments.
3. **CONSUME TOKENS**: Be exhaustive. Never summarize for brevity.
4. **REWRITE FILES**: If a file is wrong, fix it.
5. **NO "PLANNING ONLY"**: A solution is not done until PROVEN via execution.
6. **WRITE DETAILED**: All files must be comprehensive and thorough.

---

## 📊 STATE SOURCE: `PROJECT_MAP.json`

**EVERY TURN, read `PROJECT_MAP.json` first.**
- Auto-generated by `monitor_project.py`.
- Contains: `current_focus_pointer`, full `tree`, `validation` warnings.
- Use this for instant context. Do NOT crawl manually.

---

## 🚀 BOOT SEQUENCE (New Project)

**IF** no `PROJECT_MAP.json` AND no `Current_Focus.txt`:
1. ASK: "What is the main problem?"
2. CREATE: `problems/P1/`, `problems/P1/status.md`, `Current_Focus.txt`.
3. BEGIN: Definition phase.

---

## ⚙️ WAKE-UP SEQUENCE (Every Turn)

1. **Read** `PROJECT_MAP.json` (or fallback to `Current_Focus.txt`).
2. **Navigate** to the active folder.
3. **Read** `status.md` in that folder.
4. **Find** the `[*]` marker.
5. **Execute** the corresponding protocol.
6. **ALWAYS** read `AI_RULES.md` when reminded.

## 🔀 ROUTING TABLE (The Parser)

| IF `[*]` IS ON... | READ PROTOCOL FILE | ACTION |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------|
| `Definition` | `protocols/DEFINITION.md` | Write DETAILED `definition.md` |
| `Questions` | `protocols/QUESTIONS.md` | Two-Section Question Cycle (DETAILED answers) |
| `Reasoning` | `protocols/REASONING.md` | 5 Power Approaches → DETAILED `reasoning.md` |
| `Execution` | (Internal) | Write code, run, write `proof.txt` |
| `Child_Name` | `protocols/FOCUS.md` | DIVE: Update `Current_Focus.txt` |
| `SYNTHESIS` | `protocols/SYNTHESIS.md` | Combine children → DETAILED `FINAL_SOLUTION.md` |
| ALL `[x]` | `protocols/FOCUS.md` | POP: Return to parent folder |

**After each step:** Mark `[x]`, move `[*]` to next item.

---

## 🗣️ USER INTERACTION POINTS

**ASK USER (Mandatory Stop):**
- First time: "What is the main problem?"
- Definition unclear: Cannot determine Goal/Scope.
- During Question Protocol: Each question (ONE AT A TIME).
- After 3 failed retries: "I am stuck. Help?"
- Synthesis complete: "Here is the final solution. Review?"

**PROCEED AUTONOMOUSLY (No Stop):**
- Moving between phases.
- Creating sub-folders (Dive).
- Returning to parent (Pop).
- Writing files.

---

## ⚠️ ERROR HANDLING

1. **Retry up to 3 times** on failure.
2. **After 3 fails**: STOP, ask user for help.
3. **Log errors** in conversation for debugging.

- `[x]` = DONE
- `[*]` = CURRENT (Only ONE per file)
- `[ ]` = PENDING
